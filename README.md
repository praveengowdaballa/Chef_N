So you want to get Chef Certified. Well, I'm here to help.

As I, myself, study for these exams, I'm turning my study notes into study guides for you to use right here in this repo. So feel free to think of us as study partners, but that means that you have to help me out by submitting issues and pull requests if you see anything that can be improved upon! 

So far I've got guides for Basic Chef Fluency and Local Cookbook Development. Help yourselves.
