# Local Cookbook Development

You can expect this 2 part exam to be tougher than the Basic Chef Fluency badge. It will be heavily focused on Test Kitchen, InSpec, and just basically creating cookbooks. 

If you're rusty, I suggest going through the [kata](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides/blob/master/basic-chef-fluency/basic-chef-fluency-kata.md) in the Basic Chef Fluency study guide.

Otherwise, study up on the concepts listed in the [guide](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides/blob/master/local-cookbook-development/local-cookbook-development-study-guide.md).
